‚úÖ Assets
LabScope's virtual science lab includes carefully chosen assets that support curriculum goals, realistic practice, and accessibility for students in Sub-Saharan Africa.

üîß Key 3D Assets and Their Justification:
Asset Name	Use in LabScope
Chemistry Lab Tools	Beakers, test tubes, pipettes, and burners are interactable to simulate experiments like flame tests, mixing solutions, and heating compounds.
Flame Test Station	Includes burners and metal salts (e.g., Na, Cu, Li) that change flame color‚Äîkey for demonstrating chemical reactions students rarely see live.
Biology Dissection Setup	Dissection tray, virtual frog, scalpel, pins, and labels. Students can explore anatomy and follow guided instructions to identify organs.
Interactive Periodic Table	Clickable periodic table linked to in-lab simulations. Enables exploration of elements and understanding properties.
Physics-based Object Interactions	Designed to simulate weight, texture, and response of real materials when moved or combined‚Äîhelps bridge theoretical and practical learning.
Virtual Notebook + HUD	Floating instructional panels and a virtual lab journal for students to receive feedback, take notes, and log experiment data.
Lab Environment (3D Room)	Immersive virtual classroom with stations, posters, and safe zones that replicate a real-world lab, aiding in environmental familiarity.

üß† Hardware Integration (Detailed for Evaluation)
LabScope is designed for seamless integration with Meta Quest 3 to enable an accessible, controller-free or controller-enhanced experience. It supports both hand tracking and controller input for flexibility in low-infrastructure environments.

üïπÔ∏è Interaction Design:
Hardware	Function in LabScope
Meta Quest 3 Headset	Immersive visual and auditory experience for conducting experiments and exploring environments.
Hand Tracking	Enables users to pick up beakers, dissect the frog, rotate the periodic table, and interact naturally with equipment.
VR Controllers	Optional input method for more precise actions‚Äîideal for tasks requiring stable or guided manipulation.
In-Lab Navigation	Gaze-based teleporting or joystick-based movement allows users to walk to different stations within the lab environment.
Voice Guidance (Optional Future Feature)	Contextual audio guides explain steps and safety instructions in the student‚Äôs local language.

üß∞ Development Stack:
Engine: Unity (2022 LTS)

SDKs: Meta XR SDK, OpenXR Plugin

Interaction Toolkit: Unity XR Interaction Toolkit

Design Prototyping: Figma (VR interface mockups and object layout)

This setup ensures the app is optimized for standalone VR headsets (like Meta Quest 3) while remaining lightweight enough for broad deployment in schools with limited resources.
